# Monisha-s-Resume-
This project involves designing and developing a personal portfolio website to showcase professional skills, academic background, projects, and personal details. The primary purpose of the portfolio is to establish an online presence and present qualifications in a visually appealing and structured manner.

The portfolio includes multiple sections such as an introduction, skills overview, featured projects, contact information, and a downloadable resume. The resume is stored and served through Azure Blob Storage, demonstrating the integration of cloud services with frontend applications.

The website can be hosted online or run locally, offering flexibility in deployment. The complete project source code, including design assets and documentation, is maintained and version-controlled using GitHub, ensuring transparency, traceability, and collaborative development practices.
